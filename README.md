## Lessons Learned

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics: This project provides a good introduction to the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll learn how to structure a web page, style it using CSS, and add interactivity using JavaScript.

DOM manipulation: The project involves dynamically adding and removing HTML elements to the page, which requires a good understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to manipulate it using JavaScript.

Local storage: The project demonstrates how to use local storage in JavaScript to store and retrieve data from the browser. This is a useful feature for web applications that need to persist data between sessions.

Event handling: The project relies heavily on event handling to detect user actions and trigger functions in response. You'll learn how to handle events such as button clicks, key presses, and DOM mutations.

Debugging: As with any programming project, debugging is an important skill to develop. You'll likely encounter bugs and errors while working on this project, and learning how to diagnose and fix them will be valuable for future projects.
